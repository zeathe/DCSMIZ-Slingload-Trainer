Slingload Trainer
=================

Overview
--------

The mission is very simple leveraging the Nevada Test Range map.

Slingload Training is as simple as:

1 - Select your helo via a dynamic slot
2 - If cargo isn't available, use the F10 - Other comms menu to spawn cargo
3 - Select your cargo through the comms menu slingload options
4 - Hook up
5 - Drop off at your choice of the Blue, White or Green receiver zones

Be aware: some cargo is too heavy for smaller helicopters.
